Mixture Boilerplate
=============================
### Sass + Haml + Angular

This is a boilerplate for the Mixture site generation tool. It's set up using Haml and Sass for easy to read, quickly written HTML and CSS, and it's integrated with AngularJS for quickly defined dynamic data. Also integrated are Modernizr, Foundation, and of course JQuery.
